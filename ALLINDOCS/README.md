# ALLINDOCS
### -> Its a GUI Pdf Reader Application with AI Capabilities.
### -> For the Arranging the sentences it uses a model trained on a research paper to classify sentences.All information on it is available in the skimlit_project.ipynb in the current directory.
### -> Uses pre-trained 't-5' LLM for text summarization.
### -> Really Suited for Research Paper Analysis or situaions where large documents or texts are to be condensed/arranged/summarized.



# -------------------------- How To Use --------------------------
### -> Inoder to use you must have tensorflow,tkinter and pymupdf.
### -> Just Open app.py and run it.
# -------------------------- DETAILS --------------------------
### App.py -> This contains the major heart of the codebase from which everything is controlled.
### AI_engine.py -> Controlls the pipeline of the data flow and the model intialization as well as the predictions to refined label format.
### miner.py -> It is responsible for the data extraction from a pdf the metadata,pages,text in the pages etc.
### Skimlit_Project.ipynb ->Contains all the analysis of the Research Paper Mentioned in it ,the insights of the data/ data-analysis, the models used and there reasoning and finally the best light weight model found so far.
### Assests -> Contains the images used as sprites in the GUI part as well as the trained skimlit model(From skimlit_project.ipynb)
